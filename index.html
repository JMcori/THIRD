<br>The Feeling of Being Watched: Inspired by Portal 2</br>

<br>Exploring the concept of how tension is built in a game to keep the player engaged by use of sound and emptiness. How is a mood established through psychological set up. </br>
  <br>Portal 2 is a game that uses a usually unseen character to add tension as well as give instructions throughout the levels of the puzzle. 
  The voice is robotic and uses language to put down the player in a way that is meant to elevate the voice as a superior being. 
  This is often comedic but the intent sets a tone for the game that indicates that there is more to the puzzle than just getting from point A to point B.</br>

  <br>The name of this robot is GLaDOS. It is the main antagonist of the game in the beginning. T
  he game does go into different directions as it progresses, but this paper will focus on the initial setup of the game. 
  The way the world is set up is what is most interesting and catches the attention of the player initially. </br>
 <br>GLaDOS insults the player constantly but does it in what seems to be programmed jokes. Kind of how we would expect an AI to try to insult us now. It is as if it knows hÂ¡what to do but not how to do it. This adds to the uncanny feeling of this entity since it is doing something petty and human yet in a robotic, (wrong) way. It makes the put down funny to us,
  but does suggest that there is a reason for this to have been programmed into the bot or that it wants to distract us from the reasons for why it wants the puzzle to be completed.</br>
