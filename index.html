<h2> The Feeling of Being Watched: Inspired by <i>Portal 2</i> </h2>
 
 <br>Exploring how tension is built in a game while keeping a light mood for the player to 
  remain engaged yet stimulated.</br>

   <br>Firstly, let me introduce the main premise of <i>Portal 2</i> as it will explain how it relates to the philosophies of Freud, Lacan, Barthes, and Althusser. </br>

 <br>The Game begins in a room that is meant to simulate a safe environment, but as a little robot begins to try to get the player to get out of there, the room begins to collapse and reveals that it is a staged environment in a testing facility. 
This begins the trial that sets up the puzzle game. 
As we are trying to figure out where we are in this world and how to find a way out, the small robot gives hints and helps us find a Portal gun that will help us solve the various room puzzles and move forward in the game. 
Meanwhile, another robot called GLaDOS becomes our antagonist, as it seems it is who is in charge of the simulation and the human testing. </br>

<br> Here we have an image of the avatar for the player facing GLaDOS in a scene further into the game. </br>

<br> Since our player does not talk, as is common in games like this, the dialogue comes as one liners by GLaDOS and our first robot helper. These are usually mocking or threatening in nature, but at the same time offer comedic relief for the game tension to break. Sometimes there will be small hints on how to move forward within the line clips but they usually will just be a way to fill the space between actions. </br>

<br> This is my favorite example of one of these lines.</br>
